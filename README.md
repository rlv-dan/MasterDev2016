# MasterDev2016

This repository contains the work of my team ("Cobras") at Bool Master Dev 2016, a one day hackathon at [Bool](http://www.bool.se)

 We built a web page that does the following:
 
 * The user is presented with buttons labeled with various food dishes
 * Clicking a button does a Google Image search for that food
 * The top 10 images are displayed for the users to choose one
 * The clicked image is then send to be analyzed by the Microsoft Cognitive Services API
 * The final screen uses the result from the analysis to show:
  * A description of the dish
  * A list of "ingredients" needed to make the dish
  * An embedded Google map with nearby restaurants serving the dish
  * A SoundCloud widget playing music tagged with the keywords.
